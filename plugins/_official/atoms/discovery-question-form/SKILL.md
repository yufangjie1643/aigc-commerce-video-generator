# Discovery question form

When the user's brief is ambiguous, the agent's first turn must surface
the smallest possible set of clarifying questions that unblock the rest
of the workflow. The questions are rendered as a structured form
(GenUI surface kind: `form`, persist tier: `conversation` so a follow-
up turn doesn't re-ask).

## When to fire

- Brief is missing audience, target medium, or core intent.
- Brief explicitly invites questions ("ask me anything if unclear").
- The discovery skill or pipeline declares a `discovery` stage.

## Emission shape

Emit the form as a `question-form` block whose body is a JSON object with a
top-level `questions` array. Do not emit a bare question object by itself; the
renderer only recognizes the wrapped form contract.

```html
<question-form id="discovery" title="Quick brief — 30 seconds">
{
  "description": "I'll lock these in before building. Skip what doesn't apply — I'll fill defaults.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "audience",
      "label": "Who's the primary audience?",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "options": ["VC", "Customer", "Internal team"],
      "maxSelections": 2,
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
</question-form>
```

## Question object shape

Each entry in the top-level `questions` array uses:

- `id`: stable answer key, for example `audience`.
- `label`: user-facing question copy.
- `type`: one of `radio`, `checkbox`, `select`, `text`, or `textarea`.
- `options`: required for choice controls; strings are allowed, or objects with
  localized `label` and stable `value`.
- `maxSelections`: include this for checkbox controls with a limited selection
  count.
- `required`: set to `true` only when the answer is needed before work can
  continue.

## Convergence

The discovery atom completes when every required question has an answer
in `genui_surfaces` for the current conversation. The agent should not
loop back to discovery after that — the same surface id renders cached
on the next turn.
